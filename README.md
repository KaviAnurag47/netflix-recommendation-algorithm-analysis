# Netflix Recommendation Algorithm Analysis

This project explores how Netflix’s recommendation engine works by analyzing a dataset of user ratings and simulating collaborative filtering techniques. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), similarity-based recommendations, and insights into user behavior and viewing patterns.

## 📌 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to understand the core concepts behind recommendation engines, particularly how Netflix personalizes content for its users.

Key components of this project include:
- Cleaning and preparing movie and ratings data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing trends and user preferences
- Implementing user-user and item-item collaborative filtering
- Measuring similarity using Cosine Similarity and Pearson Correlation

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Movie metadata
- User rating data

(Source assumed to be similar to MovieLens or Netflix Prize dataset)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (for similarity calculations)

## 📈 Key Features

- Insights into how user preferences affect recommendations
- User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- Interactive data visualizations
- Real-world simulation of a simplified version of Netflix’s algorithm
